		<h2>About:</h2>
		<p>

			I'm Maroof, a multi-talented human with more than 3+ years of experience in design, development, &amp; deployment. You can call me Full Stack Developer, Product Designer, Web designer, Web developer, Software Engineer, or any other market-defined title related to the web.
			I don't want to define myself by the work that I have done. I define myself by the work I want to do. I prefer to keep learning and implementing. That's what I have been doing since the beginning "ZERO GUIDANCE!!!".<br/> I currently am working as a Team Lead & Full Stack Developer at
			<a href="https://www.triwits.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="yellow">Triwits</a>. I do a lot of stuff over there but I'm only good in UI/UX design, front end development, backend development, and deployement. You can find more details about me on
			<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maroof-lodi/" class="yellow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a>. I spend my spare time learning new skills & scrolling <a href="https://www.instagram.com/i_moo07/" class="yellow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a>.

		<h2>Services:</h2>

		<h4>UI/UX Design</h4>
		<p>
			UI/UX involves planning and iterating a site's structure and layout. Once
			the proper information architecture is in place, I design the visual layer
			to create a beautiful and easy to use user experience.
		</p>
		<h4>Front End Development</h4>
		<p>
			Front End Development is building out the visual components of a website.
			This also may include a CMS, API's or other integrations. I make use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJs to create fast and interactive web applications.
		</p>
		<h4>Back End Development</h4>
		<p>
			I can develop a secure and optimized back end. I also can help you with API Creation, and Database Creation. I make use of technologies like PHP Codeigniter, MySQL, MSSQL, and .NET core with Entity Framework. 
		</p>
		<h4>Mobile App Development</h4>
		<p>
			I have been creating Hybrid mobile apps in android. If you want a Native one I can give an end to end solution for your mobile app. I make use of Java for android and React Native for both both Android and iOS.
